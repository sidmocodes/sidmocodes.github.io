## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a web browser to test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
2. Navigate to the project on GitHub at [SidMoCodes](https://github.com/sidmocodes/sidmocodes.github.io).
3. Review the existing code to get familiar with the project structure and coding standards.

## Tailoring to Personal Use

The main project contains Sid Mohanty's personal data. If you intend to adapt this project for your own use:

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `<yourusername>.github.io`.
2. Clone the SidMoCodes project to your local machine.
3. Rename the cloned directory to match your domain name.
4. Customize the contents of `index.html` and associated files as needed.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.1.0.

## Forking the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Project Repository](https://github.com/sidmocodes/sidmocodes.github.io).
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner.

## Creating a Feature Branch

1. Clone your fork locally:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sidmocodes.github.io.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd sidmocodes.github.io`
3. Create a new feature branch:  
   `git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name`

## Making Changes

1. Implement your enhancements or refactors in line with the existing codebase and architecture.
2. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure functional integrity.
3. Validate the layout and styling by running your changes on a web browser.

## Commit Messages

Write precise and informative commit messages that clearly describe your modifications:

- Use present tense ("Add feature", not "Added feature")

## Code Reviews

Before creating a pull request, make sure:

1. Your code is cleanly structured and conforms to the project's coding guidelines.
2. Your changes have been adequately tested.

## Creating Pull Requests

1. Push your feature branch to your fork:  
   `git push origin feature/your-branch-name`
2. Go to the [Pull requests page](https://github.com/sidmocodes/sidmocodes.github.io/pulls) and click "New Pull Request".
3. Base should be `main` (or appropriate branch) and compare should be `feature/your-branch-name`.
